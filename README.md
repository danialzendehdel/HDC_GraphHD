# HDC_GraphHD

- Following introduction of **GraphHD** in the paper [GraphHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07826), this repository shows a simple implemenation of **GraphHD** in Python.
- The other implementation of **GraphHD** is [Graph classification notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NrmCc99GrkmHm_VLs5nv9Q7BCbCLs0ar?usp=sharing), in which the author provides the implementation in **Python Boolean Hyper-Vectors(BHV)**, However this repo uses **TorchHD** instead.
